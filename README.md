  <h3>Introduction</h3>

  <p>There have been more changes in the world as it continues to develop. Not only does the atmosphere change as a whole  but also the people within it and they learn how to adapt alongside these changes. Millions throughout the world are born with disabilities that make some things out of their reach to do. What most people consider a normal task, is what others may struggle with the most. Despite these restrictions, many humans across the globe have come up with solutions for themselves or for others, showing the adaptability of the living beings in the world. Despite struggle, solutions are made and used to overcome all hardships.  </p>

  

  <h3>What are these different changes in human lives?</h3>

  <p> Expanding on the idea of adaptation, many have shown perseverance when faced with a struggle in their life and this is the way that humans have overcome numerous catastrophes in either their individual lives or in a worldwide problem. Taking in count for example, the 2020 covid outbreak. This pandemic became a worldwide problem two years prior and many suffered great losses of family members and friends, while others were left severely distraught and weak. Despite all this, in the current year of 2022, many are able to be in contact with others again and the world and slowly but surely picked up their old ways of living. Of course not everything is back to normal, since there are still restrictions, but still, people are adjusting to these ways of living. As for individual examples, they are present throughout anyone's life, principally those who carry a disability. Though they are hard to overcome, many have shown their resilience and eventually their hard work did pay off. These are just one of the many examples of people adjusting to something considered out of their normal.  </p>

  <h4>Adjusting with disabilities</h4>
  <p>It is well known that people struggle with inability to complete certain tasks due to health related issues. When a body develops weakly, it becomes hard for a person to get through what seems like an easy daily activity. Many research studies have been conducted in order to find out what can be done for these people as part of a solution to their difficulties. These differ from medical issues from the inside of the body, to the outside of it, being examples such as vision impairment,
deaf or hard of hearing, mental health conditions, intellectual disability, acquired brain injury, autism spectrum disorder, physical disability.  </p>
